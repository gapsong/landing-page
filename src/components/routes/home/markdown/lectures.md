## Advanced Algorithmics Stundenplan 9
<https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=26944>

The course will be held in hybrid mode: Lectures will be provided via screencasts. There will be two presence sessions to briefly review the material and discuss questions.

Tuesdays 14-16 in H 1058

Thursdays 10-12 in H 2013 (This slot may not appear in the university calendar. The information here is correct.)

We do not expect these sessions to last 90 minutes, but this depends on the amount of questions asked.

Format of the course

The course will take place in a hybrid format. The main contents of the lecture will be provided by weekly videos. In addition, there are two live sessions per week

    every Monday 10:15-11:45 in room MA 550
    every Thursday 14:15-15:45 in room MA 550

There will be weakly exercises that can be discussed in the live sessions. I highly recommend to solve these exercises on your own before the live session takes places and to participate in the live sessions so that we can discuss the solution during the live sessions. To make it also possible for vulnerable students to attend the course, however, participation in the live sessions is not mandatory to pass the course.
